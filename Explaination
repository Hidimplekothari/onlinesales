MathExpressionEvaluator --
1.using the Java HttpClient class to send HTTP requests to a web API that evaluates mathematical expressions.
2.using the math.js API, which can evaluate various mathematical expressions.
3.evaluating each of the expression using the math.js API
4.This implementation reads expressions from the console until "end" is provided as an expression.
5.For each expression,it sends an HTTP GET request to the math.js API, passing the expression as a query parameter.
6.The API evaluates the expression and returns the result in the response body.
7.The Test class test the expressions provided top the input stream.


EventGenerator --
1.The EventGenerator class takes a map of outcomes and their respective probabilities in its constructor.
2.The generateOutcome() method generates a single outcome based on the given probabilities.
3.It first calculates the total probability by summing up all the probabilities.
Then, it generates a random number between 1 and the total probability.
4.By iterating over the outcomes and their probabilities,
it finds the outcome for which the cumulative probability exceeds the random number.
5.In the main method, an example usage is demonstrated for rolling a biased six-faced dice.
6.It creates an instance of EventGenerator with the provided outcome map,
it then generates the specified number of occurrences and counts the frequency of each outcome.
7.Finally, it prints the outcome and its corresponding count.
